## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**full_name** | **string** | The full name of the individual. | [optional]
**date_of_birth** | **\DateTime** | The date of birth of the individual. | [optional]
**unique_identifier** | **string** | A stable unique identifier representing the user in MitID&#39;s system. It is recommended to use this identifier instead of using the civil registration number (CPR number) directly. | [optional]
**authentication_assurance_level** | **string** | The authentication assurance level (AAL) for the verification. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) measures the confidence in a digital identity&#39;s authentication strength set by a set of requirements for different levels. More information can be found here: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b/aal/#AAL_SEC4 Possible values:              -  https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/Low - (Level 1) Provides basic confidence that the authenticator is either single factor or multifactor authentication. - https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/Substantial - (Level 2) Provides high confidence that the authenticator uses two distinct authentication factors that use secure authentication protocols. - https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/High - (Level 3) Provides very high confidence that the authenticator uses an non-exportable private key and another authentication factor.              **Note**: These urls are not valid anymore, but they still contain the level of assurance name. | [optional]
**identity_authentication_level** | **string** | The identity assurance level (IAL) for the verification. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) measures the confidence of the digital identity&#39;s verification set by a set of requirements for different levels. More information can be found here: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b/aal/#AAL_SEC4 Possible values:              -  https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/Low - (Level 1) The user has self asserted their identity and is neither verified nor validated. - https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/Substantial - (Level 2) The user has performed either a remote or in-person identity proofing. - https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/High - (Level 3) The user has performed an in person identity proofing with an authorized representative.              **Note**: These urls are not valid anymore, but they still contain the level of assurance name. | [optional]
**level_of_assurance** | **string** | The level of assurance (LOA) for the verification. This is an older retired model that is a combination of Identity Assurance Level and Authentication Assurance Level. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) measures the confidence of the digital identity&#39;s verification and authentication strength by a set of requirements for different levels.              Possible values: -  https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/Low - (Level 1) The user has self asserted their identity and multifactor authentication is not required. - https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/Substantial - (Level 3) The user has performed either a remote or in-person identity proofing and multifactor authentication is required. - https://data.gov.dk/concept/core/nsis/High - (Level 4) The user has performed an in person identity proofing with an authorized representative and has strong cryptographic authentication requirements.              **Note**: These urls are not valid anymore, but they still contain the level of assurance name. MitID only returns three of the four potential levels and does not include level 2.              More information can be found here: - https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html - https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/ | [optional]
**identification_source** | **string** | The source of the identification for the verification              Possible values: - private - The verification is from a private individual. - professional - The verification is a user in behalf of a organization. | [optional]
**civil_registration_number** | **string** | The civil registration number (CPR number) of the individual for the verification.              The CPR number is a 10-digit number in the format DDMMYYY-XXXX, where: - DDMMYYY represents the individual&#39;s date of birth (day, month, year). - XXXX is a unique identifier.              If XXXX is even, the individual is female. If XXXX is odd, the individual is male.              More information can be found here: https://international.kk.dk/live/cpr-registration-and-documents/cpr-number | [optional]
**organization_name** | **string** | The name of the organization for the verification | [optional]
**organization_number** | **string** | The organization number (CVR number). This is an 8-digit unique identifier for the organization. This will be prefixed with \&quot;DK\&quot; for VAT numbers. | [optional]
**authorized_representative_number** | **string** | The organization number (CVR number) of the organization the user is authorized to represent. This is only returned if the requested scope is for an organization verification and the user provides a private source in behalf of a company. | [optional]
