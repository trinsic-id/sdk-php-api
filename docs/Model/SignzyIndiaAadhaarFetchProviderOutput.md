# SignzyIndiaAadhaarFetchProviderOutput

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**document_type** | **string** | The document type from which the identity data was retrieved. | [optional]
**timestamp** | **\DateTime** | The timestamp when the signed document was generated and verified. | [optional]
**time_to_live** | **\DateTime** | The validity expiration timestamp for the verification document. | [optional]
**aadhaar_number_last_four** | **string** | The Aadhaar number (UID) value for the individual.              This is only the last four digits of the Aadhaar number. | [optional]
**claims** | [**\Trinsic\Api\Model\AadhaarClaims**](AadhaarClaims.md) | The claims extracted from the Aadhaar document. | [optional]
**localized_claims** | [**\Trinsic\Api\Model\AadhaarLocalizedClaims**](AadhaarLocalizedClaims.md) | The localized claims extracted from the Aadhaar document. | [optional]
**document_signature_validated** | **bool** | Whether our own validation of the Aadhaar document signature and certificate chain succeeded.              When the signed document (e.g. Digilocker XML) is available, we validate it using the standard CCA/SafeScrypt chain. When the document is not returned, the signature cannot be validated and this is false. Some providers (e.g. Signzy) also supply a separate DSC validation indicator in the webhook payload; that is independent of this flag, which reflects only our validation. |
**digilocker_id** | **string** | DigiLocker&#39;s 36-character stable account identifier.              This identifier is deemed safe to use to reference the individual. *Note, the format is not guaranteed to be a UUID. | [optional]
**issuer_id** | **string** | The identifier for the issuer of the DigiLocker document. | [optional]
**issuer** | **string** | Issuer name for the DigiLocker document. | [optional]
**mobile_phone** | **string** | The individual&#39;s mobile phone number from DigiLocker&#39;s account details. | [optional]
**scope** | **string[]** | DigiLocker consent scopes that the individual actually consented to for this session. Included in provider output so customers can verify what was granted: the customer does not control these—the individual chooses scopes in the DigiLocker consent UI, and there is no way to pre-select or enforce them. This is a common source of error (e.g. the individual skips a scope), so surfacing the granted scopes lets customers confirm the session had the expected consent. |
